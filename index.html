          <p>
            I'm a software developer and musician with a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from Nottingham Trent University (2025).  
            I specialise in mobile development, artificial intelligence, and building intuitive, user-focused applications.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            My passion lies in solving real-world problems, especially at combining technology and creativity.  
            Whether I'm building an AI-powered chatbot or a social platform for musicians, I aim to create software that connects and empowers people.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <h3>Trombonist | Jazz, Big Band & Ska</h3>
      <p>
        As a dedicated trombonist, music is a vital part of my creative identity. I perform regularly with jazz ensembles, big bands, and brass sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a member of <strong>The Hoplites</strong>, a local ska band known for its high-energy performances and distinctive brass-driven sound.  
        Beyond ska, I explore a wide range of genres including improvisational jazz and modern brass arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in both music and tech often overlap — sparking creative problem-solving, teamwork, and unique projects that bridge the two worlds.
