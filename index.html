        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have recently completed my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science at Nottingham Trent University, graduating with
            a 2:1 in July 2025. My degree has given me a strong foundation for programming and problem solving as well
            as developing my interest in software development. I am eager to apply my knowledge of programming
            languages and software to the technology industry.

            <h3>SoundWave - A social space for musicians (Final Year Project)</h3>
            <p>
              A social media mobile app connecting musicians with shared interests and discovering music opportunities. <br> <br>
                
              This project was my Final Year Project for my computer science degree. Through my primary research and research into the market, it was discovered that the existing
              social platforms fall short of addressing specific needs of people in the music industry. Therefore this application provides a solution to this problem. It provides
              features which allow users to discover musicians to collaborate with, share their own content, and explore new genres and music. <br><br>
                
              The application was developed as an Android application in Android Studio. The user interface was designed and tested in Figma using the Material 3 guidlines and 
              later exported to Android Studio. Firebase Authentication was used to ensure secure user login and the Firebase cloud technology was used to store profiles
              and content.<br>
